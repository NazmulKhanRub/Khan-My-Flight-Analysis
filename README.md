# My Flight Analysis – A Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project presents an in-depth analysis of my personal flight history spanning the past seven years. Using Power BI and Excel, I transformed raw travel data into compelling visual insights. The goal of this analysis is to identify travel patterns, flight trends, and key insights such as the most frequent departure locations, average flight durations, and seasonal travel variations.

## 🎯 Key Insights & Visualizations  
- **Departure Country Trends:** A **Treemap** visualizes the most frequent departure locations, highlighting travel preferences.
- **Flight Duration & Travel Months:** **Bar charts** showcase the average flight duration and the busiest travel months over the years.
- **Flight Trends Over Time:** A **Line Chart** tracks annual flight trends, revealing how travel habits evolved year by year.
- **Flight Distance vs. Duration:** A **Scatter Plot** compares average flight distances with durations, providing insights into travel efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Power BI** – For interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.
- **Excel (Power Query, Formulas, Data Cleaning)** – For data transformation, calculated columns, and measures.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For creating custom metrics and calculated fields.

## 🔍 The Process  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Imported flight data from Excel and cleaned it using Power Query.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created new calculated columns and measures to enhance the dataset.
3. **Data Transformation:** Used formulas and transformations in Power BI to structure the data effectively.
4. **Visualization & Insights:** Designed interactive reports using Power BI to showcase meaningful insights.

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters  
This project is a testament to my expertise in data visualization, business intelligence, and data storytelling. It demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and present data in a way that drives actionable insights. The ability to extract meaningful trends from personal data showcases real-world analytical skills applicable to any industry.
